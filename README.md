# PinTar-Keyed-Hash-Function

Cryptographic hash functions are used to protect the integrity of information. Hash functions are designed by using existing block ciphers as compression functions. This is due to challenges and difficulties that are encountered in constructing new hash functions from the scratch. However, the key generations for encryption process result to huge computational cost which affects the efficiency of the hash function. This paper proposes a new, secure and efficient compression function based on a pseudorandom function, that takes in two 2n-bits inputs and produce one n-bit output (2n-to-n bit). In addition, a new keyed hash function with three variants is proposed (PinTar 128 bits, 256 bits and 512 bits) which uses the proposed compression as its underlying building block. Statistical analysis shows that the compression function is an efficient one way random function. Similarly, statistical analysis of the keyed hash function shows that the proposed keyed function has strong avalanche property and is resistant to key exhaustive search attack. The proposed key hash function can be used as candidate for developing security systems.
